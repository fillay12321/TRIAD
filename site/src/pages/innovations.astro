    title: 'Consensus as physics: waves and interference',
    description:
      'In TRIAD, each transaction is a "wave" with amplitude, phase, and time-to-live (TTL). Instead of centralized voting, we analyze the interference pattern of waves across parallel shards. Consensus emerges where constructive interference is maximal — removing costly global ordering and accelerating finality.',
  },
  {
    title: 'DAG over linear chain',
    description:
      'The data model is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), not a single linear chain of blocks. Nodes can append events in parallel, reducing latency and increasing throughput. Conflicts are resolved via physics-inspired rules and observed interference.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Batch Ed25519 verification (ed25519-zebra)',
    description:
      'Ed25519 signatures are verified in batches, dramatically reducing crypto overhead. Instead of thousands of individual checks — one optimized batch verification, especially effective on multi-core CPUs.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Max CPU parallelism (Rayon)',
    description:
      'All CPU cores are utilized for interference calculations and validation. Parallel iterators and thread pools (Rayon) scale computations nearly linearly with core count without blocking network operations.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Sharding at the physical-model level',
    description:
      'TRIAD divides the event space into shards where waves are computed in parallel and independently. Cross-shard effects are accounted for via harmonized wave parameters and their refraction/interference at shard boundaries.',
  },
  {
    title: 'OpenCL acceleration on critical paths',
    description:
      'For heavy workloads, OpenCL integration enables GPU/accelerator offload. This lowers latency and increases throughput under high load.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Networking with peer discovery',
    description:
      'Nodes automatically discover and connect to peers, maintaining a live graph of connections for fast diffusion of waves/events. Connection errors are mapped to domain-specific error types for network resilience.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Minimal global ordering — maximal efficiency',
    description:
      'We avoid a total global order of transactions. Only necessary causal relationships are fixed, while finality is derived from the physical model. This removes the classic L1 bottleneck.',
  },
